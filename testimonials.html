                        <p>
                            My partner and I were very worried about our child's maths GCSE. The school 
                            didn't seem to be able to support her in getting a pass. Dave was brilliant,
                            making us all feel very comfortable, and in the end our child achieved the grade
                            she needed to go to college, and even started enjoying maths, which we would
                            not have believed possible before. Thanks Dave!
                        </p>

                        <h2>John James</h2>
                        <p>
                            Our son wanted to learn faster than the school could provide. Dave tailored a 
                            program for him that pushed him just the right amount. Our son really enjoyed 
                            being challenged, and with Dave's support he really flourished. He is now doing
                            a degree in math at plymouth, and always said Dave inspired him greatly. 
                        </p>

                        <h2>Yusef Johnson</h2>
                        <p>
                            We have always home educated our daughter. When she was 13, we no longer had the
                            knowledge to teach her maths ourselves. Dave took care of the whole process from
                            there, guiding her through her learning and getting her to take her GCSE a year early 
                            and do very well. We are so impressed by his ability to help her relax, and also
                            how he managed to get her the GCSE a year early.
