                        <h2>Experienced</h2>
                        <p>I have thousands of hours of maths tuition, over the last 7 years. From home
                            education to those in school. Whether you are looking to pass, or looking to
                            push your maths as far as possible, I have helped in all situations.

                        <h2>Convenient</h2>
                        <p>Having moved online in 2020, you can now recieve tutoring from the comfort 
                            of your own home, without having to commute anywhere. Students tend to be
                            more relaxed in their own home, and therefore more able to learn.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h2>Tailored to you</h2>
                        <p>I am able to provide a tailored program for the student. Whatever their needs, I can adapt 
                            to meet them, providing a learning program that is suited to their needs, and helps them
                            learn as efficiently as possible.
